## 1 Purpose of Election Analysis
 
The purpose of this analysis was to assist a Colorado Board of Elections employee, Tom, in an election audit of tabulated results for U.S. Congressional Precinct in Colorado using Python to automate the process. Tom had requested to view the following information derived from the data: 

- Total number of votes
- Number of votes received for each candidate
- Percentage of votes received for each candidate
- Overall winner of the election 

Given that the results of this coding script were successful, the code generated for this analysis can be used to audit other congressional districts, senatorial districts, and local elections.
